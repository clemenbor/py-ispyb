## py-ispyb tests

### Run test

In order to run the test, you need to install `tox`:

```bash
pip install tox
```

This command manages the test and linting verification.
To tun both of them simply type `tox`

To run only the test, you can type `tox -e py38`
To run only the linters, you can type `tox -e flake8`
